# Architecture Overview for InstaPoll

InstaPoll is designed as a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant polling application. This document provides an overview of the systemâ€™s key components and how they interact.

## System Components

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular) and served via a CDN.  
  *Responsible for rendering the user interface and communicating with the backend through the API Gateway.*

- **API Gateway:**  
  Acts as the single entry point for client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice.  

- **Microservices:**  
  - **Poll Management Service:**  
    Handles creation, editing, and storage of polls.
  - **Voting Service:**  
    Processes vote submissions and implements the voting algorithms (e.g., ranked choice).
  - **Results Service:**  
    Aggregates votes and computes results in real time.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  A message broker (such as Kafka or RabbitMQ) decouples vote submission from result processing, ensuring responsiveness even under load.

- **Data Layer:**  
  - **PostgreSQL:**  
    Stores structured data such as poll details and votes.
  - **Redis (Optional):**  
    Provides caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

- **Infrastructure:**  
  Containerized deployment using Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes. Continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) ensure reliability and observability.
